A token with minimal complete ERC20 functionality. 

No direct ETH purchases are allowed, a trusted address mints and distributes all the tokens up to the token limit, then disables minting permanently.

Things like assigning bonuses, minting tokens for the founders' endowment multisig, and handling contributions (including Ethereum) are done off-chain.
